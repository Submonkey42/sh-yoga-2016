            Us yogis believe that all people should give yoga a try and practice
            mindfulness. Yoga is more than just doing the poses on a mat. It is
            a lifestyle. When one does yoga, yoga finds its way to seep into
            aspects of their life. Yoga also builds mindfulness. within us.
            Mindfulness to us is developing the ability to objectively observe
            our thoughts and feelings both mentally. It means being aware of our
            surroundings and sensations, and it allows us to become present
            instead of allowing life to pass us by.
