                    I'm Stephanie and I'm a 10th grader at Summit Shasta. I do
                    yoga because it is super calming for both my mind and body
                    and I think that is a very important tool to have going
                    through school.

                    Hello! My name is Chaise and I attend summit Shasta. I like
                    to watch anime and listen to music in my spare time. I do
                    yoga to relax, get a good stretch in my body and become
                    flexible.

                    My name is Heather and I am a tenth grader at Summit Shasta.
                    I love music and spending time with my friends. I practice
                    yoga on and off the mat because it helps me relax when I'm
                    feeling stressed, improve my physical strength and balance,
                    and feel refreshed and prepared for my day.

                    I'm Robby and I am a 10th grader here at Summit Shasta. I
                    really enjoy coding, playing video games, being outdoors,
                    doing yoga, and hanging out with my friends (which can
                    involve doing all of those things). I've been practicing
                    yoga for two years now and it has helped me get the most out
                    of my life. When I practice yoga, I feel a sence of peace
                    and happiness that lasts the whole day. Yoga has also helped
                    me relieve stress and sleep better.

                    My name is Yvette and I'm currently a Junior at Summit
                    Shasta. I started practicing yoga last year when my PM
                    expeditions class was yoga with Mackenzie. Now I continue
                    practicing yoga on and off the mat, and with Nicole during
                    my AM expeditions class. At first I didn't like yoga and
                    never engaged with the class, but once I started to
                    participate, I quickly began to love yoga. Yoga helps me
                    release any stress and tension that school has caused me.
                    Yoga also helps me see others differently and allows me to
                    view others as equals. Because of yoga, I am more mindful to
                    others experiences and feelings. My first yoga teacher
                    mentioned that yoga to her is "the practice of getting to
                    know myself," and that too is what yoga is to me.
